This is my second prototype game made using Unity and C#, which I created as a study project while I was learning game development. This time I was learning about using some APIs like "DragonsBonesAPI", basic 2D physics and sounds managment.

<b>NOTE: Only available has a portfolio game and isn't recommended to be played has a complete game.</b>


Developed: 2017.

The game had a big influence on the retro game "Another world" from 1993 and "Silent Hill". There was another version with three different difficulties and level changes based on that, but for the long time sadly that source code is missed, so this is a previous version with an unique difficulty.
